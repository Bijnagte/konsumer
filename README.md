Konsumer
========

An very experimental and opinionated Kafka consuming library. If you choose to use
this library you should consider it unstable.

See [the example Main class](https://github.com/charliek/konsumer/blob/master/src/test/java/com/charlieknudsen/konsumer/example/Main.groovy)
for a quick example on how to start consuming with this library.
